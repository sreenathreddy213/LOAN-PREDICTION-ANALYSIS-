# LOAN-PREDICTION-ANALYSIS-
This project is focused to predict whether a customer would sign for  a loan or not based on their financial history. This will help the  companies to give promotional offers on loans and do target  camping. We attempt to find the reasons for why a customer is  signing a loan. The data set is imbalanced and hence one of the  challenges in this project is use the sampling techniques to  overcome this before building the model.

Customer apply for home loan after that company validates the  customer eligibility for loan. However doing this manually takes a lot  of time. Hence it wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real  time) based on customer information. So the final thing is to identify the factors/ customer segments that  are eligible for taking loan. How will the company benefit if we give  the customer segments is the immediate question that arises. 

The  solution is â€¦.Banks would give loans to only those customers that  are eligible so that they can be assured of getting the money back.Hence the more accurate we are in predicting the eligible customers  the more beneficial it would be for the Finance Companies.
